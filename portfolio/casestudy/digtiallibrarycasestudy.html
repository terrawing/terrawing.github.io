Each of these books are topics relating to animals, food, plants, weather, …etc for younger grades. General things that are around us for kids to learn about the world and what is around them while the main focus goal is for them to improve their reading abilities either with the physical books or using this online eBook learning tool. For the older grades, topics can be more personal such as school problems, social topics or friends.</p>

Along with the digital formatting, they also need digital assets associated with these books such as the ability for users to answer questions on what they have read, doing activities, voice recording and an endgame repeatable product for younger audiences to be rewarded in some way or format for their participation. The organization also had a limited budget deciding whether to go for fixed layouts of these books or complete redesign for responsive uses on various viewing devices.</p>

                            <p class="mt-0">Organization had 1000+ physical children’s book that needs to be converted to digital format (eBooks) because majority of the audience are now going digtial rather than having physical copies of the books. Along with the digital formatting, they also need digital assets associated with these books such as the ability for users to answer questions on what they have read, doing activities, voice recording and an endgame repeatable product for younger audiences to be rewarded in some way or format for their participation. The organization also had a limited budget deciding whether to go for fixed layouts of these books or complete redesign for responsive uses on various viewing devices.</p>
                            <p>This project case study is split into 4 different parts:</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Each of these are a product by itself that requires individual way of thinking in coming up with solutions. The only data that can be used which also spans across these products is the information collected from the physical books itself being read. The books itself were tested by some of the family members to get a general information of data (eg: did they like reading it? Will they read it again? …etc)  and feedback on the effectiveness of the product that can be portentially be used in the future in creating the digital format versions or the continuation on extending this product’s lifespan.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Due to this whole project being limited to a fixed limited budget. It was quite a challenge in deciding whether to go for a fixed static design format or a responsive design format for these ebooks.</p>
                                    <p>In order to decide which process to take. The process of time risk management was used to factor in that decision. The reason we went with this approach was because the first issue was that there are 1000+ books and is it worth the time and effort to “redesign” all 1000+ books responsively. Second factor we had to considered was that while some books the layout indeed look the same because they are from the same set created from the same author. A lot of them are standalone and require specific attention for a new design. A lot of these books will require wireframing from me and a lot of consultation between me and the art director on the right design to take for these books. The third reason is that the organization was planning to outsource a lot of the work as well to speed up the process. While outsourcing speeds up the process, their thinking and the organization’s thinking do not always align the same and this can potentially create conflicts.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">While the third factor was out of control and my stake in it was minimal. My job was to research current trends and competitors, then use one of the books as an example and redesign this book in a complete responsive process while managing how long it takes. While researching, I also have to consider accessibility (WCAG) for different types of impaired users and if it works for web development because while I can design anything, it actually has to be possible to create it with coding without breaking W3C validation and accessibility. After the first one was completed I went onwards to create 2 or 3 more designs which helps answers the second factor. That answers the average time it takes to come up with designs for responsiveness for a set of books.</p>

                                    <p>Due to time management and the requirement of 1000+ books need to be produced. A fixed layout was the final decision because redesign for responsiveness requires a lot more time and people to manage because the designs will need to be approve whereas in a fixed layout that has a similar look as the original book. Those designs are already final and require minimal changes. This fixed layout also allow the organization outsourcing to be much smoother because they just need to follow the design already presented in the physical books and this method eliminates the need for the third party vendors to redesign anything thus saving costs and time.</p>
                                    <p>Final product is not always what you produced because as much as the design is well thought out organization has to put priority to budget because they are the ones paying to have this product created.</p>

                                    <p>My approach in solving and coming up with a solution for interactive activities was that. I had to research current interactive activity products that are out in the current market such as Math Prodigy, Didax Math and Raz Kids. Understand what younger kids like to do on them. I have also leisurely observed my niece on her tablet on the activities she is playing with and why it it enjoyable for her.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Colour scheme and typeface was also important because from my understanding and through research was that younger kids perfer brighter, warmer colours which makes it look more friendly as opposed to adults that prefer darken, more standard typeface (Like a classy, simple type of look). Since the eBook have to follow suite to accessibility, the activities inside also have to have proper accessibility attributes and especially the colour scheme has to pass for contrast.</p>

                                    <p>Full screen interactive activities were implemented throughout each eBooks and they are easy to used for younger kids because they are features which is commonly used in other kids websites and the mobile apps they used very often such as large imagery, thick fonts and simplified controls.</p>
                                    <p>Font size and typeface is very important because just the typography itself can make or break the intended purpose of the product. At first we I was using typefaces that were much more rectangular, while that look clean but it did not work for younger kids because it looked more like it was intended for adults. I had to change to a more rounded font to give it a softer look which match what kids tend to see on commercial products.</p>

                                    <p>In order to come up with the design for the recording feature. I took the road of looking for designs that are associated with recoding mobile apps that are on the google play store and the apple store. The reason I went with this method is because some of the recording features out there, it requires a lot of clicking and it might be adding too much unnecessary work for younger kids just to do what they need to do. Extra features but not needed for this type of user are like changing the quality, adjusting the volume and saving multiple files.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">My formula to this feature is to eliminate all the extras and go straight to direction function. Direct function such as implementing as minimal steps as possible for the younger kids to record their voice and that is it without seeing all the extra technical features. Even the saving the recorded voice file is simplified.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Research, low fidelity Research was used to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the number of clicks required to record and save a recording. Low fidelity for the overall design for stakeholders. A high fidelity prototype was only partially needed because it even though it follows the same design style as the activities, the colours are different.</p>

                                    <p>The elimination of addition buttons that felt unnecessary because some buttons we able to perform 2 different features (Play and pause buttons reduced to 1 where the user can click just 1 button to either play or pause instead). Download and close buttons were reduced to 1 where when click it closes this recording feature and auto saves the file.</p>
                                    <p>The lesser amount of click the better it is because the overall user experience should not take that many clicks just to get something done. Some features, I was able to be combine rather than seperate which allows simplification. This simplification prevents the user from making unnecessary mistakes and it makes them easier to understand what they need to do. The purpose of this is to try and prevent users from being confused by swamping them with multiple features and clicks.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>This part of the project I had to take notes during a moderated user testing session. The organization and a room with a group of teacher participants with moderators asking questions about their experience with younger students during class time.</p>
                                    <p>Using this information gather I was able to decipher that younger kids like to create something from scratch. This can be an entire environment world like adding trees, building house, roads, …etc. or be very dedicated in creating their own online persona of a character. These traits are very common for boys that like to play with lego and build something out of an empty canvas or girls that enjoy dressing up their dolls and role-play. Using these type of data I was able to create some personas to meet those criteria and align the organization’s product goal towards that direction.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">The second approach that I used to add for this reward system is from my gaming background. Today’s games are full of shops or marketplaces for customization and skins. This is a huge plus to keep them interested and continuously engaged because it allows for more options in changing their environments or characters. A similar product feature is also found in Raz Kids however they are only limited to creating a rocket ship which is not every kid’s interest. One thing to note is that an important conversation with stakeholders, we were able to come up with the idea of reading books as a currency to be used to purchase more items in these shops or marketplace rather than using actual money paying currency which is a “pay-to-win” situation and it is not something we want to implement since it is turning this into a gamification scenario.</p>

                                    <p>This feature is still ongoing because the high fidelity prototype has not been build yet so it has not passed stakeholders nor been tested with actual young students as of yet. The ground work has been done such as personas to emulate the actual young students to create different use cases. As well as a user webflow to have a general idea how the users will interact with the product and what they can expect this reward system to do.</p>
                                    <p>The use of personas allow me to narrow down what they like to do which was customization of things. This allows me to implement that main feature into the reward system and is the main driving force on how to retain our users to continue reading at a pleasant pace without forcing them to so.</p>
