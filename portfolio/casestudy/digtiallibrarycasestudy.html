Each of these books are topics relating to animals, food, plants, weather, …etc for younger grades. General things that are around us for kids to learn about the world and what is around them while the main focus goal is for them to improve their reading abilities either with the physical books or using this online eBook learning tool. For the older grades, topics can be more personal such as school problems, social topics or friends.</p>

Along with the digital formatting, they also need digital assets associated with these books such as the ability for users to answer questions on what they have read, doing activities, voice recording and an endgame repeatable product for younger audiences to be rewarded in some way or format for their participation. The organization also had a limited budget deciding whether to go for fixed layouts of these books or complete redesign for responsive uses on various viewing devices.</p>

                            <p class="mt-0">Organization had 1000+ physical children’s book that needs to be converted to digital format (eBooks) because majority of the audience are now going digtial rather than having physical copies of the books. Along with the digital formatting, they also need digital assets associated with these books such as the ability for users to answer questions on what they have read, doing activities, voice recording and an endgame repeatable product for younger audiences to be rewarded in some way or format for their participation. The organization also had a limited budget deciding whether to go for fixed layouts of these books or complete redesign for responsive uses on various viewing devices.</p>
                            <p>This project case study is split into 4 different parts:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>eBook</strong></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>eBook Activity</strong></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Recording Feature</strong></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Reward System</strong></p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="mb-0">Each of these are a product by itself that requires individual way of thinking in coming up with solutions. The only data that can be used which also spans across these products is the information collected from the physical books itself being read. The books itself were tested by some of the family members to get a general information of data (eg: did they like reading it? Will they read it again? …etc)  and feedback on the effectiveness of the product that can be portentially be used in the future in creating the digital format versions or the continuation on extending this product’s lifespan.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Due to this whole project being limited to a fixed limited budget. It was quite a challenge in deciding whether to go for a fixed static design format or a responsive design format for these ebooks.</p>
                                    <p>In order to decide which process to take. The process of time risk management was used to factor in that decision. The reason we went with this approach was because the first issue was that there are 1000+ books and is it worth the time and effort to “redesign” all 1000+ books responsively. Second factor we had to considered was that while some books the layout indeed look the same because they are from the same set created from the same author. A lot of them are standalone and require specific attention for a new design. A lot of these books will require wireframing from me and a lot of consultation between me and the art director on the right design to take for these books. The third reason is that the organization was planning to outsource a lot of the work as well to speed up the process. While outsourcing speeds up the process, their thinking and the organization’s thinking do not always align the same and this can potentially create conflicts.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">While the third factor was out of control and my stake in it was minimal. My job was to research current trends and competitors, then use one of the books as an example and redesign this book in a complete responsive process while managing how long it takes. While researching, I also have to consider accessibility (WCAG) for different types of impaired users and if it works for web development because while I can design anything, it actually has to be possible to create it with coding without breaking W3C validation and accessibility. After the first one was completed I went onwards to create 2 or 3 more designs which helps answers the second factor. That answers the average time it takes to come up with designs for responsiveness for a set of books.</p>
