                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>While that is an approach that the stakeholders and I thought about for quick fix, in a real world scenario, this is not very ideal. The reason this is not a good idea to implement is because the customer is expected to have those features and by eliminating them, the entire scope is change and there can be a lot of repercussions in doing so.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately with this turn of events. I had to take a step back and go with a mobile first approach. Even though the main platform for teachers is that they will be using the desktop to majority of their work. The mobile first approach is to make sure it still presentable for phones and allows the stakeholders and me and really dig deep and dive into what functions are really necessary and what functions can be either combined to be used in a different situation or in a worst case taken out all together. </p>
                                    <p>A Powerpoint presentation was presented to show to stakeholders where all the features from a desktop will be located and placed on a small device such as a mobile phone.</p>
                                    <p>The functions search, lesson and plan creation require some researching and thinking to accomplish an effective UI because these are the 3 main functionality that the teachers will see and use very often. How I approach with the researching for these three are that I was looking for similar functions on other websites that are effectively working. </p>
                                    <p>For the search function, my main idea was deviated from Google. Google had a bunch of tabs for filters and it is this filter idea that I have chosen to use for the search. I want the use of filters to be the main focus for allowing users to search what they need and populating the results with the filter keywords that they have chosen.</p>
                                    <p>For the lessons page, since I had to use a mobile first approach. It was a matter of carefully thinking of how to transition the functions that are group together to a bigger environment. I also while researching that I really enjoyed the layout of the Google search and the Facebook mobile app where the user can tab through different categories. And because these two are really popular among users, I incorporated this function so it should be easy for them to understand how to navigate right away.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Lastly, Plan creation functionality, my research is actually from my previous knowledge of other projects I have done as freelance. The way it was designed and function behaves like a Wordpress dashboard. In the image section where the admin can upload images. There is an option where the user can click the upload button or drag images directly from their desktop windows into the “drop zone” area. I want to mimic that idea but modify for this web application. Instead of having the “files” on their desktop. It is in a collected pool on the website where the teacher can click or drag which lesson into the plan. From doing all this efficiently, a plan will then be generated.</p>

The user webflow was also created to narrow down what main pages need to be created and how they interact with each other. I have use Lucid chart and pen and paper sketches to come up with ideas of placement quickly for functionalities for the low-fidelity wireframes. After that I used Adobe XD for the high fidelity prototypes to showcase the potential look to the stakeholders.</p>

                                    <p>Parts of the product is still being built as of today and the organization is still waiting for feedback from their testers. Not all functionality are there at the moment because the organization wanted to do usability testing in partial chunks of the website before going live with the whole web application. </p>
                                    <p>Other things I got out to this project is that I learned that mobile first approach allows the designer to set the pace and look of the entire website much simpler. It is always easy to add things rather than remove things because you will never know if that function will be useful in the future or not. By taking it out the users might question why there is so much misinterpretation between what was promised and what was delivery, so thus this might need to bad customer relationship.</p>
