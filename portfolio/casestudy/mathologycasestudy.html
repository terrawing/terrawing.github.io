This web application also offer tools that were made specificially from the physical Mathology kits that were purchased by teachers. It allows them to use these lessons and plans that are preset and give them the ability to modify it to their specific needs of their classrooms.</p>

                            <p class="mt-0">Teachers need a way to create lesson plans aim towards for students and collect ideas from lesson plans that were previously done by other teachers, basically a way to shared among each other online. Besides sharing, these online lessons and plans have potential to be used in the future for other teachers that wish to purchase the physical Mathology kits and be able to access the same materials as the previous teachers can. Current customer teachers also need a way to edit the plans from the kits that they have purchases because not all teaching lessons are fixed and can be use as the same for each classroom.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">The second issue which came up that will affect the market heavily is that it also needs to work on a tablet device because some teachers will do their planning on a tablet in addition to their laptops. So the design needs to be responsive even though a small mobile phone device is not optimal in doing this type of work. We will still need to present them a good design, so we do not alienate anybody using this web application.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>At first for the first few screens only, I was designing the most difficult screens (screens that have a lot of data and/or functionality actions) on a desktop view. The major idea I took away from those few screens were figuring out how to put everything in there without making the screens look busy and keeping it clean with a lot of white space. However with this approach is achievable on a desktop view, there were a lot of issues when the web application needs to downsize to smaller devices like the tablet or phone causing the user interface to suffer. A lot of issues came about because with smaller devices and a lot of data and actions, we had to cut out a lot of tasks and features.</p>
                                    <p>While that is an fast solution that the stakeholders and I thought about for quick fix, in a real world scenario, this is not very ideal. The reason this is not a good idea to implement is because the customer is expected to have those features and by eliminating them, the entire scope is change and there can be a lot of repercussions in doing so.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Unfortunately with this turn of events, I had to take a step back and rethink of a better idea. The new idea was to go for a mobile first approach, even though the main platform for teachers is that they will be using the desktop to majority of their work. The mobile first approach is to make sure it still presentable and usable for phone devices. It allows the stakeholders and me to really dig deep and dive into what functions are really necessary to keep. What functions can be combined to be used in a different situation? Lastly in a worst case scenario, take out the functionality all together.</p>

                                    <p>The three main functions: search, lesson and plan creation require more researching and thinking to accomplish an effective user interface because these are the three main functionality that the teachers will see and use very often. How I approach with the researching for these three are that I was looking for similar functions on other websites that are effectively working and people that are accustomed to. </p>
                                    <p>For the search function, my main idea was deviated from Google. Google had a bunch of tabs for filters and it is this filter idea that I have chosen to use for the search. I want the use of filters to be the main focus for allowing users to search what they need and populating the results with the filter selections that they have chosen.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">For the lessons page, since I had to use a mobile first approach. It was a matter of carefully thinking of how to transition the functions that are in a bigger environment into something that can be group together that make sense for the user (Eg: a whole sub section into a single collapsable accordion). I also while researching that I really enjoyed the layout of the Google search and the Facebook mobile app where the user can tab through different categories. Since these two are really popular among users, I wanted to incorporated this function. However because of my experience with similar scenario on other projects, not many users enjoy a horizontal draggable tab bar since there are too many tabs to fit on portrait view for this web application. My best solution was to use a drop down menu instead to switch the screens. This solution would not only be much straight forward but it also reduce the need to add a heading to the current view thus giving up more space in an already heavy space restricted environment.</p>

                                    <p>Lastly for the plan creation functionality, my research is actually from my previous knowledge of past projects I have done as freelance. The way it was designed and function behaves like a Wordpress dashboard. In the image section where the admin can upload images. There is an option where the user can click the upload button or drag images directly from their desktop windows into the “drop zone” area. I want to mimic that idea but modify for this web application. Instead of having the “files” on their desktop, it is the user's favourite collected pool of lessons on the website where the teacher can click or drag which lesson into the plan. From doing all this click or drag efficiently, a plan will then be generated.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Having all these ideas collected and sketched out in one way or another, a Powerpoint presentation was later presented to show to stakeholders where all the features from a desktop will be located and placed on a small device such as a mobile phone.</p>

This behaviour works similiarily to how a Wordpress dashboard behaves, such as uploading media content. So a similar design and functionality was used here to populate lessons within a single plan.</em></p>

                                    <p><strong>What I learned and what I go out of this?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Parts of the product is still being built as of today and the organization is still waiting for feedback from their usability testing. The major function such as sharing a plan is currently implemented as a button part of the options on what to do inside the plan. Future tests will need to be conducted if furthermore such as individual lesson inside a plan needs to have the option to share as well. Not all functionality are there on every page at the moment because the organization wanted to continuously do usability testing in partial chunks before going live with the whole web application. </p>
                                    <p>Other things I got out to this project is that I learned that mobile first approach allows the designer to set the pace and look of the entire website much simpler. It is always easy to add things rather than remove things because you will never know if that function will be useful in the future or not. By taking out a functionality, the users might question why there is so much misinterpretation between what was promised and what was delivered. These decision mistakes can cause ramification leading to bad customer relationship and potential future customers.</p>
