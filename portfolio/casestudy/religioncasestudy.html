While previous grades from grade 1 to 6 already have their own version of the websites completed, this new website will be used not only for grade 7 but the same layout will applied to grade 8 as well. So in general, this website is basically for both grade 7 and 8 with image swaps for the higher grade. Included with the website are the eBooks that are associated with the website's grade level. The physical copies of these books are used in classrooms for both teachers and students but electronic ones can be used by students that wish to use it at locations other than schools.</p>

                            <p class="mt-0">The organization currently have websites set up from grade 1 to 6 for students to login and learn about various information regarding the catholic faith. Unfortunately, the grade 5 and 6 are the only ones that are more modern in today's standards for user experience but it is still far from perfect. For the higher grades such as grade 7 and 8 students, the organization wish to make use of today's new designs and trends. If they were to instead follow the same path as grade 5 and 6 and use the same design and user experience, there will be much more time and work to correct the issues in the future. There is also a possibility based on the outcome of the seven and eight that the organization will come back and revisit the younger grades (1-4) and revamp those websites with the newer designs and trends because they are currently out of date.</p> 
                            <p>Another issue was that the grade 7 and 8 students have a different age gap from grade 5 to 6 thus their way of thinking and interests will be way different. Sadly, using the same template idea that saves money and time will not work very effectively for the end user. The third issue while not really a big issue is that the website will developed by third party vendors. The issues that can arise from third party vendors is that there can be a lot of miscommunication on what the organization wants the product to do and what the vendors understand. I have witness this firsthand and it is something that is unfortunately unavoidable even if everything seems to go perfect in the beginning.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">For the eBooks unlike the website their design are similar because the physical version of the books follow the same layout thus making it possible to have the same design theme. The organization needs to have these eBooks behave the same way whereas the website has to look and behave differently. Be that as it may, the issue with these eBooks are that they have many pages per book, almost 200+ pages.

                            </ol>
                            <p>The goal of the new website is to design the Grade 7 and 8 website using today’s modern technologies, interfaces and experience standards. These new characteristics should be engaging to the intended users while still keeping some elements similar to the grade 5 and 6 websites. Although the new websites that are going to be created are different visually and function-wise, they still belong to the same Growing in Faith, Growing in Christ series.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">For the eBooks, the objective is to find a solution that is usable for book editors, vendors and the designer. This solution needs to reduce or even eliminate the time the designer needs to create, edit and maintain the designs. The best case scenario in the long run is to just minimize the need of the designer’s time in participating on these eBooks.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Since this is a new product itself, there was zero data to work with from the very beginning. The only information presented were hypothesizes of bahviours of young teenagers and statistics of grade 6 students on technology use from stakeholders which may or may not be practical to this new website. So in order for this website to start on a good foundation that can be build upon on and for stakeholders to be convinced about the project, I had to do research on it, present in a way to sell them the ideas and to mention the pros and cons of my choices.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">In my research, the important key points that I was looking for were current web trends on sites that are popular with early teenagers. I also look into existing user interfaces that are prevalent and effective to the current year as well. These sites for example can be range from clothing stores such as the Gap, Aritzia, H&M or Rebook to streaming sites such as Netflix or Twitch TV. Other than looking at the designs only of these websites, I have also played around and taken notes of the behaviours of social media sites because a main aspect of this site which I wanted to include was sharing between peers. I took a look at how Facebook, Twitter and Instagram behaves. I also took a look at other sites that have sharing and social media options that are not as popular as these social media big three. While researching new ideas are important, I also had to consider some of the functionality and designs from the previously done grade 5 and 6 website because these books are an entire series, so there has be some elements that are identical to tie the websites together while looking different at the same time.</p>

In a related task of collecting this important data I have also used it to create personas which can determine the expectations, difficulties, behaviours and final goals the young teenagers might have when using the product. These personas for this project are not only for the end user but as a second functionality, it is used in changing the business decisions of stakeholders. One example that was encountered by stakholders was the decision of lazy loading everything or pagnation in sub pages. Lastly, with the finished personas, the stakholders and me  were also able to create user journeys, web flows and narrow down functions/interactions.</p>

A design documentation was the overall solution to solving this problem. This design documentation is for vendors so they can follow certain guidelines while developing this website. Examples found within the guidelines are, colours, font sizes, typefaces, and fixed widths/heights for elements just to name a few. This documentation produced is also a live documentation because it needs to be updated while the vendors are working on the website. For instance, the vendors might pick up something I have missed or the stakeholders found something that needs to be changed. All in all these discoveries are very important in order to have a good relationship between both parties since it is a way of helping each other. </p>

The research was the most important because as a brand new project with zero data to work with. Powerpoint presentation was used to present my findings to stakeholders, so they have an idea what they will get from this project.The low and high fidelity sketches were used to display the designs. Personas were created and used to understand how an average user will use the product. Created the user webflows for the overall map of the system. The user journeys to mainly test and answer use cases. Lastly to put this website together, a PDF version design guide was created for the vendor to use to code the design.</p>

                                    <p><strong>What I learned and what I go out of this?</strong></p>
                                    <p>The religion grade 7 website is currently live right now and being used by catholic schools. Some of the features from the original idea proposed generated new problems that had to be cut due to technology constraints and the extra budget required to make those features happen. New problems such as the features in the forums page because that requires a database full of usernames and passwords, thus a lot of security is required that adds to the cost. The other problem is that it requires a constant moderator so posts are appropriate for all users across. However, while some of those features were forced to be removed, simplify and easier versions were created. For the forums, we had to change it from a larger scale to a smaller scale by allowing users to ask questions via email thus a single moderator is only needed just to read and reply. Also multiple accounts were restricted to a fixed class account which we provide the username and password. So for one there is not many newly created accounts from unknown users and two we will know which school is associated wtih which account. Aside from solving the problems, there were also a lot of positive feedback. From the conversations of the stakeholders that are part of sales. They said this website is getting a lot good feedback from the schools that purchased this item and it is connecting with the intended users which is exactly what the organization want the product to behave.</p>
                                    <p>The research phase was very valuable in creating a product that is more aligned with the user. Rather than just building something that appeal to us only. The feedback in the end that we got from the finished product shows that it is an important phase that should not be skipped and should be done all the time. It is also because of this approaching attitude and going out of my way that got me an “Innovation Award” from the organization. I’ve learned that with researching, everything else that needs to be created afterwards also easily fell into place.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>The main goal for the eBooks of this was to reduce or even better to eliminate the need for the designer to spend too much time on this project. The solution that we thought of was to use something like Bootstrap but in a design format.</p>
                                    <p>In Bootstrap, as a developer it is a popular CSS framework that gives them the resources for them to build proper website while making sure it is responsive and mobile first. In this case it requires minimal CSS from the developer and the developer just needs to worried about the HTML DOM, javascript and/or any backend framework. In our case, it is also a CSS framework for people developing but also for book editors because they can pick and choose the design that are in the examples.</p>
                                    <p>My job in solving this problem was to take the designs that are currently in the physical books and change it to responsive format using CSS. Since it requires more work to get my idea to the developer to code the CSS. I was in-charge with coding the CSS myself.</p>
                                    <p>The main components to this design bootstrap is that it is separated by grade so each book has it’s own set of components. However while some designs remain the same, some components share similar designs. Each component is split into 5 categories: we have elements which are you standard paragraph text, titles, lists, blockquotes and images. Measurements, those include spacing, alignments and location of objects. Styles, which consists of font sizes, bold, italic, colours. Lastly components, those are big pieces like a whole accordion that houses many elements, a card that is a group of elements that looks like a card, sidebars, …etc.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Within all these 5 components, the designs are there and finalized. The job of the editor is then to pick and choose the pieces they need to build this into an eBook format and the developer uses the code snippet associated in the design bootstrap to make the design appear on the web player afterwards.</p>

                                    <p>This case require a complete different approach rather than using pen and paper for sketches or low / high fidelity prototype. I had to jump straight to the responsive design using CodePen to see what works and cannot work. While I can make the designs on my prototype softwares, it also needs to be able to be coded and work for the web. For example, there is a fixed HTML structure I have to follow, I can not make a box go to the right side on the opposite of the screen while something is on the left because the HTML has limited tags and unless I write more HTML, than it can be possible.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Each of these 2 products require two different types of research and have 2 different types of audiences. While one is targeted towards grade 7 or 8 students, the other product not only targets grade 7 or 8 students but to the book editors as well because they are the ones that seemingly have to put the eBook together.</p>

                                    <p>The final product for me was not the eBook itself but the design bootstrap of the eBook. This web application now consists all the design components that is fully responsive for each of their specific grades that allows the book editors to pick and choose the components to match the order of the physical books. The third party vendors are also presented not only code snippets but also coding instructions and files (css & javascript)  for download to use these designs.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">With this final product, even though the best outcome which is the elimination of the designer’s time was not achieved. The tasks to maintain was reduced drastically, which is the purpose of creating this design bootstrap. What I learned out of this was that my CSS knowledge has majorly improved from my previous knowledge and this allows me to present designs that are much more achievable through the web due to its limitations.</p>
