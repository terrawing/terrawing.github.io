While previous grades such as the grade 5 and 6 already have the websites completed. This new website will be used not only for grade 7 but the same layout to be also used for grade 8 as well. Included with the website is the eBooks that are associated with the website. The physical main copy of it is used in classrooms for the teachers and students but electronic ones are used for the students that wish to use it at locations other than at school.</p>

                            <p class="mt-0">Organization currently have 2 websites set up for grade 5 to 6 for students to login and learn about various information regarding the catholic faith. Unfortunately over time designs and trends tend to change and for grade 7 and 8 students, the organization want to make use of these new designs and trends and create brand new websites for those 2 grades while still belonging to the same series. Another issue was that the grade 7 and 8 students have a different age gap from grade 5 to 6 thus their way of thinking and interests will be different so using the same website from grade 5 or 6 as templates for 7 and 8 will not work that effectively. The third issue while not really a big issue is that the website will developed by third party vendors.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">For the eBooks unlike the website their design are similar because the physical version of the books, the layout follow the same design theme. The organization needs to have these eBooks behave the same way whereas the website has to look different. Another issue with these eBooks are that they have many pages per book, almost 200+ pages. It requires too much of the designer’s (me) time to come up with designs for each individual page.</p>

Also proper clear instructions are needed for third party vendors in order to keep this project from going back and forth too many times. For the eBooks, a way to reduce or even eliminate the time for the designer to be needed to work on this or just to minimize the designer’s need for participation on these eBooks.</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Website</strong></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>eBook</strong></p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="mb-0">Each of these 2 products require two different types of research and have 2 different types of audiences. While one is targeted towards grade 7 or 8 students, the other product not only targets grade 7 or 8 students but to the book editors as well because they are the ones that seemingly have to put the eBook together.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Since this is a new product itself. There was zero data to work with. The only information presented were hypothesizes from stakeholders which may or may not be true.</p>
                                    <p>So in order for this product to start and for stakeholders to sign on, I had to do research on it and present in a way to sell them the ideas. Things that I was looking for that were important were current web designs and trends on sites that are popular with early teenagers. These sites for example can be clothing stores such as the Gap, Aritzia, H&M, Rebook, …etc. Besides looking at the designs of these sites. I have also research the behaviours of social media sites because a main aspect of this site which I wanted to include was sharing between peers. I took a look at how Facebook behaves, twitter, instagram and I also took a look at other sites that have sharing options while not as popular as the main social media sites. While researching new ideas are important, I also had to consider some of the functionality and designs from the previously done grade 5 and 6 website because the books are an entire series, so there has be some elements that are identical to tie the websites together while looking different at the same time.</p>
                                    <p>From the data collected and presented to stakholders. Stakeholders were able to decide on what they like and did not like thus leading me able to create some personas that fit within those traits.</p>
                                    <p>Balsamiq was used to created the low fidelity to get a general sense idea of how the website looks and functions which then is presented to stakeholders again. During the creation of the low fidelity prototype, a user webflow was also created to show how the user can transition between pages and the overall depth of this website. However while the low fidelity was used as a start up design for this project, majority of the design changes and decisions had to be made on the high fidelity prototypes versions.</p>
                                    <p>During the creation of the low fidelity prototype, a user webflow was also created to show how the user can transition from one page to another, basically to visualize the map of this website’s entire structure.  A user journey was built along with the user webflow. The reason it was created because it allows us to pinpoint from the user web flow to meet certain conditions. It was also created to test if a function is viable or needed in the final overall product.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">For the process of third party vendors developing this website, I had to create a design documentation for them so they can follow certain guidelines while creating the site. Guidelines such as, colours, font sizes, typefaces, fixed width and heights of certain elements, …etc. This documentation is also a live documentation because it needs to be updated while the vendors are working on the site because sometimes the vendors might pick up something I have missed and it needs to be in the documentation which will be used in the overall of the entire website.</p>

The research was the most important because as a brand new project with zero data to work with. Powerpoint presentation was used to present my findings to stakeholders, so they have an idea what they will get from this project.The low and high fidelity sketches were used to display the designs. Personas were created and used to understand how an average user will use the product. Created the user webflows for the overall map of the system. The user journeys to mainly test and answer use cases. Lastly to put this website together, a PDF version design guide was created for the vendor to use to code the design.</p>

                                    <p><strong>What I learned and what I go out of this?</strong></p>
                                    <p>The religion grade 7 website is currently live right now and being used by catholic schools. Some of the features from the original idea proposed generated new problems that had to be cut due to technology constraints and the extra budget required to make those features happen. New problems such as the features in the forums page because that requires a database full of usernames and passwords, thus a lot of security is required that adds to the cost. The other problem is that it requires a constant moderator so posts are appropriate for all users across. However, while some of those features were forced to be removed, simplify and easier versions were created. For the forums, we had to change it from a larger scale to a smaller scale by allowing users to ask questions via email thus a single moderator is only needed just to read and reply. Also multiple accounts were restricted to a fixed class account which we provide the username and password. So for one there is not many newly created accounts from unknown users and two we will know which school is associated wtih which account. Aside from solving the problems, there were also a lot of positive feedback. From the conversations of the stakeholders that are part of sales. They said this website is getting a lot good feedback from the schools that purchased this item and it is connecting with the intended users which is exactly what the organization want the product to behave.</p>
                                    <p>The research phase was very valuable in creating a product that is more aligned with the user. Rather than just building something that appeal to us only. The feedback in the end that we got from the finished product shows that it is an important phase that should not be skipped and should be done all the time. It is also because of this approaching attitude and going out of my way that got me an “Innovation Award” from the organization. I’ve learned that with researching, everything else that needs to be created afterwards also easily fell into place.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>The main goal for the eBooks of this was to reduce or even better to eliminate the need for the designer to spend too much time on this project. The solution that we thought of was to use something like Bootstrap but in a design format.</p>
                                    <p>In Bootstrap, as a developer it is a popular CSS framework that gives them the resources for them to build proper website while making sure it is responsive and mobile first. In this case it requires minimal CSS from the developer and the developer just needs to worried about the HTML DOM, javascript and/or any backend framework. In our case, it is also a CSS framework for people developing but also for book editors because they can pick and choose the design that are in the examples.</p>
                                    <p>My job in solving this problem was to take the designs that are currently in the physical books and change it to responsive format using CSS. Since it requires more work to get my idea to the developer to code the CSS. I was in-charge with coding the CSS myself.</p>
                                    <p>The main components to this design bootstrap is that it is separated by grade so each book has it’s own set of components. However while some designs remain the same, some components share similar designs. Each component is split into 5 categories: we have elements which are you standard paragraph text, titles, lists, blockquotes and images. Measurements, those include spacing, alignments and location of objects. Styles, which consists of font sizes, bold, italic, colours. Lastly components, those are big pieces like a whole accordion that houses many elements, a card that is a group of elements that looks like a card, sidebars, …etc.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Within all these 5 components, the designs are there and finalized. The job of the editor is then to pick and choose the pieces they need to build this into an eBook format and the developer uses the code snippet associated in the design bootstrap to make the design appear on the web player afterwards.</p>

I had to jump straight to the responsive design using CodePen to see what works and cannot work. While I can make the designs on my prototype softwares, it also needs to be able to be coded and work for the web. For example, there is a fixed HTML structure I have to follow, I can not make a box go to the right side on the opposite of the screen while something is on the left because the HTML has limited tags and unless I write more HTML, than it can be possible.</p>

                                    <p>The final product for me was not the eBook itself but the design bootstrap of the eBook. This web application now consists all the design components that is fully responsive for each of their specific grades that allows the book editors to pick and choose the components to match the order of the physical books. The third party vendors are also presented not only code snippets but also coding instructions and files (css & javascript)  for download to use these designs.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">With this final product, even though the best outcome which is the elimination of the designer’s time was not achieved. The tasks to maintain was reduced drastically, which is the purpose of creating this design bootstrap. What I learned out of this was that my CSS knowledge has majorly improved from my previous knowledge and this allows me to present designs that are much more achievable through the web due to its limitations.</p>
