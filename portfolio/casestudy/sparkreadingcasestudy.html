Each of these books aiming for the younger grades have topics relating to animals, food, plants, weather, …etc. General things that are around us for kids to learn about the world and what is around them. The end goal of all these books are to help them improve their overall reading abilities either with the physical books or using this online eBook learning tool. For the older grades, topics can be more personal or mature such as school problems, social topics or friends.</p>

Along with the digital formatting, they also need digital assets associated with these books such as the ability for users to answer questions on what they have read, doing activities, voice recording and an endgame product for younger audiences to be rewarded in some way or format that is repeatable for their continuous participation in reading. The organization while wanting all these features also had a major road block, a limited budget. This limited budget also affects a very important factor whether to go for fixed layouts (HTML pages that are fixed design) of these books or complete redesign for responsive uses (mobile friendly) on various viewing devices.</p>

                            <p>There are a couple of goals that need to be achieved throughout this entire project because there are many different components. They are redesign the eBooks for responsive devices, create engaging user interfaces for questionaires within the activities and another user interface for voice recording. Lastly for the the reward system, it is to come up with some sort of a product that has repeatable usage and longevity. This product for younger students should align with their way of entertainment, retain its fun nature and maintain constantly interesting to keep them login for long periods of time. All in all, the organization want the reward system to have all these all these attributes without turning the product into an actual game itself.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Each of these are a product by itself that requires individual way of thinking in coming up with solutions. The only data that can be used which also spans across these products is the information collected from the physical books itself being read. The books itself were tested by some of the family members to get a general information of data (eg: did they like reading it? Will they read it again? …etc)  and feedback on the effectiveness of the product. This information collected is very viable because it is from this that the organization potentially can use them in the future in creating digital format versions and forecast if this is a good idea in the continuation on extending the whole product’s lifespan.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How did I go about in solving this problem?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Due to this whole project being limited to a fixed budget, it was quite a challenge in deciding whether to go for a fixed static design format or a responsive design format for these ebooks. Just a general decision on which of the two to choose was not going to be the best approach because as of this time that this project has started, responsive design was practically systematic in most web pages out in the web. So therefore, the organization had to think of a strategy to decide which of the two to take.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">In order to decide which process to take. The process of time risk management was used to factor in that decision. The organization gave me a chance to see what I can do and multiple that by a 1000 times to find an estimate in cost and time. The reason we went with this method was because there were couple of issues on this specific eBook creation. The first issue was that there are 1000+ books and we had to ask ourselves, is it worth the time and effort to “redesign” all 1000+ books responsively with limited manpower? A lot of these books transitioning to eBooks will require wireframing from me from beginning to end. For each iteration of wireframing to get to the final design, many back and forth consultation is required between the art director and me on the right design to take for these eBooks. There will also be days when a stakeholder also wants to make a decision on how the design should look for certain eBooks because there are some components that are very important and should be the focal point of that page. In the end, these decisions over a long run will cause a big ripple in the duration of the project.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-0">Second factor we had to considered was that some book layouts look the same because they are from the same series created from the same author. While a similar design can be accomplished for those set of books, a lot of them are also standalone and require specific attention for a new design everytime. Lastly, the third issue is that the organization was planning to outsource a lot of the work to "speed" up the process. While on paper, outsourcing does feel like it speeds up the process, however their thinking and the organization’s thinking do not always align the same and this can potentially create conflicts.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Although the third issue was out of control and my stake in it was minimal, my job was to research current trends and other competitors. Using what I acquired through researching, I would then use one of the books as an example and redesign this book in a complete responsive process while managing how long it takes. While researching, I also have to consider the web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) for different types of impaired users and if it works for web development because while I can design anything, it actually has to be possible to create it with coding without breaking W3C validation and accessibility. After the first one was completed I went onwards to create 2 or 3 more designs which helps answers the second factor. It gives the organization answers for the average time it takes to come up with designs for mobile responsiveness for a set of books.</p>

                                    <p><strong>What I learned and what I go out of this?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Due to time management and the requirement of 1000+ books that need to be produced, a fixed layout was the final decision. The organization's stakeholders chose this outcome because redesigning for responsiveness requires a lot more time and people to manage. The designs will always need to be constantly looked at and approved whereas in a fixed layout that has a similar look as the original book, the design is already approved when the books got printed. Since those designs are already final and require minimal to no changes, these fixed layouts allowed the organization to outsource to third parties thus making the process a much smoother pace. Seeing that the organization chose to use third party vendors, the vendors just need to follow the design already presented in the physical books and this method eliminates the need for them to redesign anything and in a way saving costs and time in the end.</p>
                                    <p>In conclusion, what I learned from the organization chosing to use third party vendors instead of internal resources is that the final product is not always what you produced. Stakeholders are required see the  bigger picture which can eclipse a design process that is even well thought out. The number one important rule for stakeholders is prioritzing any projects within the budget because they are the ones paying to have this product created.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">My approach in solving and coming up with a solution for interactive activities is like any other project that I have done which is to research on current products that are currently working. After some extensive exploring, I have narrowed it down to these popular products that are currently hot in the market. These interactive activities come from Math Prodigy, Didax Math and Raz Kids. What I wanted to take away from these sites is try to understand what younger kids like to do on these activities and the commonality between these 3 websites. In addition to my research, I have also leisurely observed my niece on her tablet on the activities she is playing with and why it it enjoyable for her. While also unrelated in the activity, I also witness her playing on the Nintendo Switch on the games she spends a lot of time on. For me as a takeaway from this, it was to get a general idea how the user interface looks and the user experience that comes from those games.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-0 mb-0">The colour scheme and typeface choice were also very important in designing for this age group. In all 3 of those websites, something that I found in common throughout the research was my understanding that younger kids prefer brighter colours. These special type of colours have warmer and friendlier attributes as opposed to monochromatic which are prefer by adults. Typeface for kids are more rounded that gives a "soft feeling" compare to basic typefaces like Times New Roman serif fonts that are more prone for adult readers. Since these activities are also integrated as part of the eBooks, all the colours, font choices, font sizes and functionality have to be align with proper W3C accessiblity standards.</p>

Research from existing and competiting products were used to find colour combinations that can presumably go well together. This method also helped to find proper uses of fonts that is appropriate for the younger age group. Low fidelity wireframes has always been the bread and butter for startup to get a quick design and the high fidelity prototypes were produced to display the designs on different viewing devices and presenting them to stakeholders.</p>

                                    <p>In the end, the designs that I have introduced and presented as high fidelity prototypes were used as the eBook activity application. Full screen interactive activities were implemented throughout each individual eBooks from the 1000+ books. As of right now the ones that are completed are currently being used by younger kids. From the latest feedback there were not many user experience issues because for one some of the features are commonly used in other kids websites and mobile apps which they are all familiar with already. Second is that I followed the accessibility guidelines as best as possible, so it did not affect the overally experience of the user navigating the activity due to a well designed user interface.</p>
                                    <p>The font size and typeface I have chose were very important overall because just the typography itself can make or break the intended purpose of the product. At first I wanted to use typefaces that were much more rectangular (sans-serif) because it is clean and easy to see. Although that look clean, it did not work for younger kids since it looked more like it was intended for adults. It was a good decision to make that change considering at the end of the day it was effective to use a much more rounded font to give it a softer look that matches what kids like to see on current successful products.</p>

                                    <p>The issues with recording programs or applications is that there are so many out there already and are working as intended. In order to come up with the design and functionality for the recording feature that works well with this Spark Reading project, I had to look for products that are out there that are targeted only to children. These products range from general voice recordings web applications to physical recording toys. During my research for mobile/web recording apps and toys, I notice a similar pattern that spans across all these products. The pattern I noticed was that both toys and recording applications targeted at children have big recording buttons and little need of customization on recording. When compared with general recording applications, the user can customize the decibels and remove background noises just to name a few. I believed these features are unecessary for this age group and might be too complicated for the intended user. So for the recording feauture, I chose to cut off all those extras and just have a standard of recording and stop recording only.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">In addition to the recording itself, there are also other preliminary screens before that. For those screens, I want to keep the same simplicity which is eliminate all the extras and have straight forward directions for them to do what they need to do and then move on.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Research was used first, a mockup with low fidelity wireframing was next and to finish it off with a high fidelity prototype on Figma. Research was used to discover the reason to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the number of clicks required to record and save a recording. Balsamiq was used to create low fidelity wireframes, so it was a cleaner approach to present a quick overall design and word description functionality for stakeholders. Lastly, while not very critical to create a high fidelity prototype was only partially needed because it follows the same previously design style as the activities.</p>

                                    <p>What I attained from this project is that a lot of functionalities can be combined together to perform 2 different tasks instead of having them as individuals. Record and stop buttons reduced to 1 where the user can click just 1 button to either to start recording or stop it instead. The second instance of this is the download and close buttons combined together to download the voice recording automatically and close the recording feature all at once.</p>
                                    <p>As a result of reducing the amount of buttons which cause lesser amount of clicks, the better the user experience became overall. For something that was created and targeted for younger children, the user experience should not take that many clicks just to get something done. This streamlining prevents the user from making unnecessary mistakes and it makes this feature easy to understand what they need to do.</p>

                                    <p>This part of the project I had to work in different steps than my previous ones. In a rare instance, I was at at a live discussion where I had to take notes during a moderated user focus group session. How this was organized was that this was all set up in a regular room with a group of teacher participants with moderators asking questions about their experience with younger students during class time.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Using this information gathered, I was able to decipher that younger kids like to create something from scratch. This can be an entire environment world like adding trees, building house, roads, …etc. or be very dedicated in creating their own online persona of a character. For example, these traits are very commonly shown for boys that like to play with Lego and build something out of an empty canvas or girls with their Barbie doll whom to be fond of playing dress up with them and role-play. Using these type of data collected, I was able to create some personas to meet those criteria and align the organization’s product goal towards that direction.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-0 mb-0">The second step on this project was internal meetings for people associated with this project. In summary, what we want to get out of the meetings using the personas as our pinpointed users was that we want to have an open canvas and let the younger kids decide what they want to customize on it. All these assets can be customized through rewards acquired by paying with in game currencies that is earned through non-linear ways. Surprisingly, this is also something I am very familiar with or have experience because of the games I play during my free time for my hobbies. There is a lot of comparision between this reward system and the current games out there right now. Today’s games are full of shops or marketplaces for customization and skins. This is a huge plus to keep them interested and continuously engaged because it allows for more options in changing their environments or characters. A similar product feature is also found in Raz Kids however they are only limited to creating a rocket ship which is not every kid’s interest. In order to prevent this from turning into a game completely, we had to make sure this reward system is actually for educational purposes first and fun entertainment second.</p>

The user focus group's main purpose was to collect data information of both pros and cons of children's behaviors and what are their likes and pet peeves of certain things in a classroom environment. This data would not only be used to create the final product but also create personas that align with the product's vision. The research itself was to create a more percise persona character which can be used for inhouse testing trials before getting real users to actually test the product if it effective or not. Low fidelity wireframes were created for the overall first round designs and finally a user webflow to map out this section of the entire web application.</p>

                                    <p>Before I left the organization, this feature is still ongoing because the high fidelity prototype has not been build yet so it has not passed stakeholders requirements nor been tested with actual young students as of yet. However, the ground work has already been completed such as personas to imitate the actual young students to create different use cases. A somewhat completed user webflow is there to give a general idea how the users will interact with the product and what they can expect this reward system to do.</p>
                                    <p>Other things I got out of this is that, the organization is trying it's best to not to gamify this reward system because as mentioned before the reading of the eBooks should be first priority before the fun entertainment part. This is why in the end they have decided to use the eBook reading as the only way to gain in-game currency to purchase assets and environments. For the weaker readers, the spinner was introduced as a way for them to catch up to younger children that were more expertise in reading. In the aftermath of introducing the spinner, it gives everyone a fair advantage regardless of reading skill level.</p>
                                    <p>I also learned that the use of personas allow me to narrow down what the user will like to do such as customization of certain things. The result of creating personas allows me to sell this feature to stakeholders and to have it implement as the main feature into the reward system. In anticipation of this main feature, I am looking forward to seeing this as the main driving force on retaining the current users to continue reading at their own pace while still having fun as well.</p>
