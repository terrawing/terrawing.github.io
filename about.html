                        <p>I am currently a freelance designer with many job titles. I have done work for graphic design both print and digital. I have worked on user interface designs for both children and adults. I have develop websites as a front end web developer due to the fact of my knowledge of front end user interfaces and what is possible for the web. Lastly I have experience with user experience design that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users of both new and existing products.</p>
                        <p>Some history background for myself is that I am originally from Hong Kong and came to Canada in the 1990s. I currently live in greater Toronto area where I went to school during my earlier years. Surprisingly "design" was not actually my first choice when I was growing up but eventually "design" did grow on me and this is the career path that I have chosen since then to now. I have chose to proceed the career path of "design" because  it is something I find great interest on change for the better and how I can see the world in a different perspective.</p>

                        <p>You might ask why did I choose such a profile picture on this page that best describe me? I chose this picture not because I want to show off but to show that I am a very active person. You might also wonder what does this have to do with "design"? How I treat working out and being active is that I like to find the issues that I am lacking in my body, this can be weak hamstrings, lack of mobility or even sitting too much and then from these issues I like to find solutions and fix the problem.</p>
                        <p>In "design" this is the same scenario where I try to overcome it the same way. I look at the current issue or challenge and try to solve that problem. Another similarity between the two is that with the physical activity issue, it is not just going from point A to B. It's not like one day I have this problem and next day I solve it. I actually need to understand the issue , do the research, test it out and check to make sure it is effective as it is. For user experience design, the same method can be said. Researching, testing and evaluating, and repeat if necessary.</p>
                        <p>I personally enjoy working on projects that are completely new that requires a preliminary researching phase all the way into the end towards the visual design. I love to start from the beginning because it allows me to create products that are more inline with the user since I have a better understanding of the user's requirements or needs and it allows me to make adjustments if those requirements or needs change during the process.</p>
                        <p>Besides working on projects, I am always trying to grow and learn something new. This can be new programming libraries, new design trends or even new personal hobbies. Currently I am looking for new opportunities and am open to new projects.</p>
